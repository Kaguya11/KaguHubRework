# ✨ Kagu Hub [![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=Kaguya11.KaguHubRework)]

This project is a universal hub that works with many games.

The hub is optimized, organized and simplified to the highest level to ensure its efficiency, optimization and speed.

The project is out of beta, but there may still be some bugs. Feel free to create pull requests, report issues, or contact me through any of my related platforms.
